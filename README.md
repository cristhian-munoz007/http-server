# http-server
Multithreaded http server in Rust

Wrote is server was written in order to teach myself Rust. 

Took an Udemy tutorial to build the basics of the server, and learn the basics of the language. Then used "The Book" in order to make it multi-threaded.

The next step is learn tokio and bring in async into the server.
